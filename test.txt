proc coeffecient
percent chance
damage

Commando - Ability -> 50 damage w/ proc coeff 1.0
atg -> 10% --- * 3.0 w/ proc coeff 1.0
level 1 50 * 1.0 = 50 ABILITY ONLY

Assuming all attacks proc ATG and we are using Commando Ability

50 damage * (3.0 * 1.0) = 150 --> ATG ONLY

50 + 150 TOTAL DAMAGE

- every items effect is different 
- need a way to find every chain
- need a way to calculate every chain
